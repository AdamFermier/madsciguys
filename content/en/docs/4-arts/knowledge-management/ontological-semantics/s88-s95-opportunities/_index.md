## Abstract

The "paper on glass" paradigm represents a transformative approach to industrial process documentation, where traditional paper-based records are digitally replicated while maintaining familiar workflows. This paper explores how such systems can be enhanced through alignment with established manufacturing ontologies, specifically ISA-88 (S88) batch control and ISA-95 (S95) enterprise-control integration standards, creating a unified framework for recipe management and process data capture.

## Introduction

Manufacturing industries have long relied on paper-based documentation for recipe management, batch records, and process data collection. The "paper on glass" concept digitizes these familiar interfaces while preserving the cognitive patterns operators have developed over decades. However, true digital transformation requires more than visual replication—it demands semantic alignment with standardized ontologies that enable interoperability, data consistency, and automated processing.

## The Paper on Glass Experience

### Visual Familiarity with Digital Power

The paper on glass interface maintains the visual metaphors of traditional documentation:
- Form-based layouts that mirror paper worksheets
- Signature fields and approval workflows
- Checkbox lists and manual data entry points
- Familiar navigation patterns and information hierarchy

However, beneath this familiar surface lies a sophisticated data model that captures not just values, but semantic meaning, relationships, and process context.

### Contextual Data Capture

Unlike simple form digitization, true paper on glass systems capture:
- **Temporal context**: When actions occurred relative to process phases
- **Causal relationships**: How parameters influence outcomes
- **Operational context**: Who performed actions and under what conditions
- **Equipment state**: The configuration and status of process equipment
- **Material genealogy**: Traceability of inputs through transformation

## S88 Ontology Integration

### Recipe Hierarchy Alignment

The S88 standard defines a clear hierarchy for batch processes:

```
Recipe Level → Procedure → Unit Operation → Operation → Phase
```

Paper on glass systems aligned with S88 map traditional recipe cards to this structure:

- **Master Recipe**: The idealized process definition
- **Control Recipe**: Site-specific adaptation with equipment bindings
- **Batch Record**: Execution instance with actual parameters and results

### Procedural Control Elements

S88's procedural control elements provide semantic structure for recipe steps:
- **Phases** become interactive workflow steps in the digital interface
- **Operations** group related phases with clear start/end conditions
- **Unit Operations** align with equipment modules and process cells
- **Procedures** represent complete processing sequences

### Equipment Entity Modeling

The S88 equipment model maps directly to paper on glass interfaces:
- **Process Cells** become top-level organizational units
- **Units** correspond to major equipment systems
- **Equipment Modules** represent controllable subsystems
- **Control Modules** map to individual instruments and actuators

## S95 Enterprise Integration

### Functional Hierarchy

S95 defines four levels of manufacturing operations:
- **Level 4**: Business planning and logistics
- **Level 3**: Manufacturing operations management
- **Level 2**: Supervisory control
- **Level 1**: Basic control

Paper on glass systems typically operate at Levels 2-3, bridging operator interfaces with enterprise systems.

### Information Models

S95 information models provide structure for:
- **Work Orders**: Linking recipes to production schedules
- **Material Definitions**: Standardizing ingredient and product specifications
- **Equipment Information**: Maintaining asset hierarchies and capabilities
- **Production Performance**: Capturing efficiency and quality metrics

### Activity Models

S95 activity models define standard operations:
- **Production Scheduling**: Translating demand into executable recipes
- **Production Dispatching**: Assigning resources to batch executions
- **Production Execution**: Real-time monitoring and control
- **Production Tracking**: Historical analysis and compliance reporting

## Unified Recipe Management Framework

### Recipe as Executable Specification

When aligned with S88/S95 ontologies, recipes become more than instructions—they become executable specifications that:
- Define precise control sequences
- Specify material requirements and constraints
- Establish quality checkpoints and acceptance criteria
- Enable automatic equipment configuration
- Support predictive quality modeling

### Semantic Data Binding

The ontological alignment enables semantic data binding where:
- Process parameters are linked to their physical measurements
- Material additions are tracked through inventory systems
- Quality attributes are connected to analytical results
- Deviations trigger defined response procedures
- Historical data supports continuous improvement

### Cross-Recipe Learning

Standardized ontologies enable learning across recipes:
- Common phases can share optimization insights
- Material properties influence multiple formulations
- Equipment performance patterns apply across products
- Quality correlations span recipe families

## Implementation Architecture

### Ontology Layer

The foundation consists of:
- **S88 Process Model**: Defining procedural hierarchy and equipment entities
- **S95 Information Model**: Structuring materials, personnel, and equipment data
- **Domain Extensions**: Industry-specific concepts and relationships
- **Semantic Mappings**: Linking legacy data to standardized concepts

### Data Capture Layer

This layer provides:
- **Contextual Forms**: Paper-like interfaces with semantic data binding
- **Workflow Engine**: S88-compliant procedure execution
- **Real-time Integration**: Connecting to process control systems
- **Validation Rules**: Ensuring data quality and compliance

### Analytics Layer

Advanced capabilities include:
- **Process Mining**: Discovering optimization opportunities from execution data
- **Predictive Quality**: Using historical patterns to predict outcomes
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifying deviations from normal operation
- **Continuous Improvement**: Systematic recipe refinement

## Benefits and Outcomes

## Conclusion

The paper on glass paradigm, when properly aligned with S88 and S95 ontologies, represents more than interface modernization—it creates a foundation for intelligent manufacturing. By maintaining operator familiarity while introducing semantic rigor, these systems bridge the gap between traditional process knowledge and modern digital capabilities.

The key to success lies not in abandoning proven workflows, but in enhancing them with structured data capture, standardized semantics, and intelligent automation. This approach preserves the valuable tacit knowledge embedded in traditional practices while enabling the data-driven insights necessary for competitive manufacturing.

As industries continue their digital transformation journeys, the paper on glass concept provides a pathway that respects operational heritage while embracing technological possibility. The alignment with established ontologies ensures that today's digitization efforts build toward tomorrow's intelligent manufacturing systems.
