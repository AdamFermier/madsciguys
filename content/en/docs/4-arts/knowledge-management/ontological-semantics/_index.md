## Archectecture of Ontological Semantics

The key components required to build a knowledge framework leveraging the "Ontological Semantics" that has helped enable the current field of "Large Language Models" which help us to create knolwedge out of existing sources in a systematic manner.

### A set of static knowledge sources

- **Ontology**
- **Fact Repository**
- **Lexicon**
- **Onomasticon**

### A knolwedge Representation Language

Helps derive meaning from ontologies and lexicons leveraging domain specific facts and associated onomasticons

### Semantic Analyzer - Large Language Models

Helps drive the user interactions to the overall knowledge management framework that is setup by "Ontological Semantics" framework.

### Supported use cases

Ontological semantics can help support:

- Text Summarization
- Question and Answering 
- Artifically Intelligent Agents

### Advantage on Ontological Semantics

Ontological Semantics provides a "Glass Box" approach to managing your knowledge vs a "Black Box Approach" where how said knowledge is generated is not explainable.
