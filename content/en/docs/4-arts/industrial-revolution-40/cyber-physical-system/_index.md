## What Are Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)?

Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) integrate computational (cyber) and physical processes. They combine sensors, actuators, networks, and software to monitor and control physical systems in real time. CPS are essential for automation, enabling intelligent decision-making and adaptive control.

## Importance in Industrial Revolution 4.0

In Industry 4.0, CPS play a critical role by enabling smart manufacturing and automation. Their importance includes:
- **Real-time Monitoring & Control** – CPS use IoT sensors and AI to monitor and optimize industrial processes, reducing downtime and improving efficiency.
-	**Predictive Maintenance** – Machine learning models analyze sensor data to predict failures before they happen, minimizing costly disruptions.
- **Autonomous Decision-Making** – AI-driven CPS can make real-time adjustments to production processes without human intervention.
- **Digital Twins** – Virtual representations of physical systems allow simulations and optimizations before implementing changes in the real world.
- **Improved Supply Chain Management** – CPS improve tracking, automation, and coordination between suppliers, manufacturers, and logistics providers.
- **Enhanced Safety & Security** – CPS enable real-time hazard detection and automated responses to ensure worker and equipment safety.
- **Energy Efficiency & Sustainability** – Smart monitoring optimizes resource use, reducing waste and energy consumption.
- 
CPS are the backbone of smart factories, autonomous vehicles, healthcare automation, and even smart grids, making them essential for the future of Industry 4.0.
