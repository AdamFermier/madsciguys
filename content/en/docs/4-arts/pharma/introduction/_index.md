Description: Key focus areas for pharma
---

The pharmaceutical industry relies on a structured approach to ensure the safety and efficacy of new drugs, which entails a comprehensive clinical development process. This journey is guided by International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) regulations, which establish global standards for drug development and approval. Additionally, advancements in automation—both in laboratory settings and manufacturing plants—play a crucial role in enhancing efficiency and data accuracy throughout the process. This framework will explore these three interconnected areas: 

- Clinical development process
- Impact of ICH regulations
- Role of automation in the pharmaceutical landscape

## IRR depends on both efficiency and value creation

R&D Spending:

- Increased from $139.2 billion in 2022 to $145.5 billion in 2023 (4.5% rise).

Asset Development Costs:

- Average cost to progress an asset from discovery to launch remains at $2.3 billion (steady from 2022 to 2023).

Peak Sales Forecast:

- Average forecast peak sales per pipeline asset dropped from $389 million in 2022 to $362 million in 2023.
- Continued decline from 2021 peak of $500 million, largely due to high-value COVID-19 assets.

## Artificial Intelligence and Pharma

There has been a lot of hype around AI and pharma - how it can reduce costs and remove a lot of manual labor that for sometime was always seen as necessary human activities, that is writing.  But now with large language models, AI can really start eroding away at those manual human tasks and launch us into the Industry 5.0 mentality of workers with AI assistance to do their jobs.
