The pharmaceutical industry relies on a structured approach to ensure the safety and efficacy of new drugs, which entails a comprehensive clinical development process. This journey is guided by International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) regulations, which establish global standards for drug development and approval. Additionally, advancements in automation—both in laboratory settings and manufacturing plants—play a crucial role in enhancing efficiency and data accuracy throughout the process. This framework will explore these three interconnected areas: 

- Clinical development process
- Impact of ICH regulations
- Role of automation in the pharmaceutical landscape
