The International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) is unique in bringing together regulatory authorities and the pharmaceutical industry to discuss scientific and technical aspects of pharmaceuticals and develop harmonised guidelines. Since its inception in 1990, ICH has evolved to address the increasingly global nature of the pharmaceutical sector, with its guidelines now adopted by a growing number of regulatory authorities worldwide. The mission of ICH is to achieve greater harmonisation to ensure that safe, effective, and high-quality medicines are developed, registered, and maintained efficiently while meeting rigorous standards. As of 2015, ICH has expanded to include 23 Members and 35 Observers. ([ref](https://www.ich.org/))

## Our Focus

This section explores the evolving landscape of pharmaceutical harmonisation, with a focus on three key areas:

### ICH Core Guidelines

The ICH Core guidelines form the foundation for global pharmaceutical quality, safety, and efficacy standards. These guidelines are organized into several series, including:

- **Quality (Q) Guidelines:** Covering topics such as stability, analytical validation, impurities, and pharmaceutical development.  
  See: [ICH Quality Guidelines](https://www.ich.org/page/quality-guidelines)

- **Safety (S), Efficacy (E), and Multidisciplinary (M) Guidelines:** Addressing nonclinical safety, clinical studies, and cross-cutting topics.

Explore the [ICH Core documents](./ich-core/) for detailed breakdowns of each major guideline, including Q1–Q14 and their practical implications.

### Quality by Design (QbD)

Quality by Design (QbD) is an advanced approach promoted by ICH to ensure pharmaceutical quality through proactive design and robust process understanding. QbD principles are embedded in guidelines such as ICH Q8–Q12, focusing on:

- Systematic development and manufacturing
- Risk management and knowledge management
- Continuous improvement throughout the product lifecycle

Dive into our [QbD section](./ich-qbd/) for resources, case studies, and biopharmaceutics applications, including real-world examples and supporting documents.

### TransCelerate and Industry Collaboration

Beyond ICH, industry consortia like TransCelerate BioPharma are driving innovation in clinical development and regulatory science. TransCelerate’s initiatives complement ICH’s harmonisation efforts by:

- Streamlining clinical trial processes
- Advancing data standards and digital solutions
- Promoting best practices for quality and compliance

Learn more about these collaborative efforts and their impact on global pharmaceutical development in our [TransCelerate resources](../transcelerate/).
