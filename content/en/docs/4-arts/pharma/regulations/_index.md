When working in regulated environments — especially in life sciences — it's not enough to just store your data. **You must store it in a way that ensures it can be read, interpreted, and audited years down the line.** This is more than a best practice — it’s a regulatory requirement.

## What’s the Regulation?

This requirement comes from **21 CFR Part 11**, which governs electronic records and signatures. Specifically:

- **21 CFR 11.10(c)** requires that records are "*accurate and ready for retrieval*" throughout their retention period.
- The **FDA’s 2018 guidance on data integrity** reinforces that if records are stored in **non-human-readable or proprietary formats**, companies must **retain the software or system** needed to render them readable.

> If you save data in a format that only your application can read, you must keep that application around — or make sure the data is also available in a human-readable format.

This ensures that critical records don't become inaccessible just because the original software is obsolete.

## What About Global Regulations?

This principle isn’t unique to the U.S. The **EU GMP Annex 11** says the same:

> "*If the system is no longer supported, data should be migrated to a supported system or maintained in a way that is readable.*"

In other words, **accessibility, integrity, and readability over time are non-negotiable** — even if your systems evolve.

## What Should You Do?

- **Retain readable exports** (e.g., PDFs, CSVs) alongside raw data whenever possible  
- **Document how to interpret** data stored in custom or proprietary formats  
- **Keep legacy applications or emulators** if needed, or plan for timely data migration

## Bottom Line

Regulations don’t just care *that* you kept the data — they care whether you (or an auditor) can actually **understand** it years later. If it’s locked away in a black box, you're on shaky ground.
