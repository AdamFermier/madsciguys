Effective data collection is the backbone of scientific progress in pharmaceutical research and manufacturing. To answer the [critical question](../1-critical-question/), teams must gather both historical and new data, building a robust foundation for process knowledge and understanding (PKU).

Data collection is not just about amassing informationâ€”it's about ensuring that the right data is captured, in the right format, and with the right context. This enables meaningful analysis, supports regulatory compliance, and drives continuous improvement.

Key considerations for data collection include:
- **Defining Data Needs:** What specific data is required to address your scientific or operational question? This may include process parameters, material attributes, environmental conditions, and outcomes.
- **Historical Data Mining:** Leveraging existing datasets can reveal trends, variability, and potential risks. However, legacy data may be incomplete or inconsistent, requiring careful curation and validation.
- **Designing New Experiments:** When gaps exist, targeted experiments should be designed to generate high-quality, reproducible data. This includes clear protocols, standardized measurements, and rigorous documentation.
- **Data Integrity and Traceability:** Ensuring data is accurate, complete, and attributable is essential for both scientific validity and regulatory compliance (see ALCOA+ principles).
- **Integration and Accessibility:** Data should be stored in interoperable formats and systems that facilitate sharing, analysis, and long-term access.

For a deeper exploration of these concepts and practical strategies for building process knowledge and understanding, see [this paper](2018-rutgers-fermier-higgins.pdf) by Fermier & Higgins (2018), which discusses the challenges and best practices in pharmaceutical data collection and PKU.
