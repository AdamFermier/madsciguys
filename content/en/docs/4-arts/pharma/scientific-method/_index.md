## Scientific Method in the Digital Age

The core principles of the scientific method—asking questions, forming hypotheses, designing experiments, collecting data, and sharing results—remain unchanged. However, in the digital era, how we document, analyze, and communicate our work must evolve to ensure research is transparent, reproducible, and collaborative.

Inspired by [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.org), this section explores methodologies and best practices for reproducible research in pharmaceutical science. The Turing Way emphasizes that reproducibility is not just a technical challenge, but a cultural one, requiring open tools, clear documentation, and inclusive collaboration.

## Digital Tools Should Empower, Not Restrict

Just as you wouldn’t store your money in a bank that makes it hard to withdraw, you shouldn’t use digital tools that lock away your data. Choose platforms and software that support open standards, easy export, and sharing—ensuring your research remains accessible and reusable.

## The Problem

Traditionally, scientists have relied on paper notebooks for discovery and documentation. In the digital age, however, research data and workflows are often managed as "IT problems," disconnected from the scientific process. This can lead to fragmented records, poor reproducibility, and barriers to collaboration.

## Mitigation

We aim to educate scientists and engineers on digital methods and trends that support the entire research lifecycle:
- Use open-source, community-driven tools for data collection, analysis, and sharing.
- Document every step of your process, from hypothesis to publication, in a way that others can understand and reproduce.
- Adopt version control, automation, and collaborative platforms to streamline teamwork and transparency.

## Design Decisions

To ensure global scalability and long-term accessibility:
- Every recommended tool must meet open-source criteria.
- Workflows should be designed for interoperability, transparency, and ease of use.
- Documentation and code should be shared in public repositories whenever possible.

By aligning with the principles of The Turing Way, we can foster a culture of reproducible, open, and collaborative science—accelerating discovery and ensuring that our work benefits the broader scientific
