## Design Thinking

A design thinking approach is essential for clearly defining the outcomes you aim to achieve in pharmaceutical research and manufacturing. This phase is about being prescriptive and intentional—identifying the business value, reviewing historical knowledge, and determining what gaps must be filled to move forward.

Scoping projects during the design phase is critical. It allows teams to "dare to dream" and innovate, while ensuring that every experiment or process improvement is grounded in a clear understanding of context. In manufacturing, this context is often captured through material genealogy—the detailed record of how materials and processes are linked throughout production.

Understanding and documenting this genealogy is foundational for reproducibility, traceability, and process optimization.
