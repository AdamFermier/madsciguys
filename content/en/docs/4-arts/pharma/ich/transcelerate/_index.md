Components of the framework helps organization compartmentalize and deliver on the final vision and strategy.  Key components within which we are foundational include:

-   Understanding the context (Internal & External environments)
-   Leadership Commitment to Quality (e.g., proactive risk mitigation)
-   Organizational Commitment (e.g., ownership by everyone)
-   Continuous Improvement (e.g., never satisfied with status quo)
