Quality by Design (QbD) is a concept that has defined a harmonized pharmaceutical quality system applicable across the life cycle of the product emphasizing an integrated approach to quality risk management and science.  QbD is a systematic approach to pharmaceutical development that emphasizes the importance of understanding the product and process. It focuses on building quality into the product from the outset, rather than testing for quality at the end of production. The key principles of QbD include:

- Understanding the Product and Process: Thoroughly characterizing the product and its intended use, as well as understanding how the manufacturing process affects product quality.
- Defining Quality Attributes: Identifying critical quality attributes (CQAs) that need to be controlled to ensure the desired quality of the final product.
- Risk Management: Employing risk assessment tools to identify and mitigate risks associated with the product and process.
- Design Space: Establishing a defined range of conditions under which a process can be expected to operate consistently and produce a quality product.
- Continual Improvement: Incorporating feedback and data from manufacturing and quality control to optimize processes over time.

New ICH guidelines (High level guidelines, more visionary, less prescriptive, flexible regulatory approaches)

- ICH Q8 (Pharmaceutical Development):
Focuses on the importance of designing pharmaceutical products and processes that meet predefined objectives and quality criteria.
- ICH Q9 (Quality Risk Management):
Provides a framework for quality risk management principles and tools to help identify, evaluate, and mitigate risks throughout the product lifecycle.
- ICH Q10 (Pharmaceutical Quality System):
Describes a comprehensive quality system that integrates quality principles into the pharmaceutical manufacturing process to ensure consistent product quality.
- ICH Q11 (Development and Manufacturing of Drug Substances):
Addresses the development and manufacturing of drug substances, emphasizing the scientific understanding of the process and product.
- ICH Q12 (Lifecycle Management):
Provides a framework for managing the lifecycle of products in a manner that supports continual improvement and ensures quality throughout the product's life.

Focused on defining design space and proposed control strategy to ensure product is maintained in the intended multivariate specifications

## Summary
Quality by Design is a proactive approach that integrates quality into the development and manufacturing processes. The associated ICH guidelines provide a framework for implementing QbD principles effectively, ensuring that pharmaceutical products are developed with a focus on quality from the start.
