The International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) is unique in bringing together the regulatory authorities and pharmaceutical industry to discuss scientific and technical aspects of pharmaceuticals and develop ICH guidelines. Since its inception in 1990, ICH has gradually evolved, to respond to increasingly global developments in the pharmaceutical sector and these ICH guidelines are applied by a growing number of regulatory authorities. ICH's mission is to achieve greater harmonisation worldwide to ensure that safe, effective and high quality medicines are developed, and registered and maintained in the most resource efficient manner whilst meeting high standards. Since its announcement of organisational changes in October 2015, ICH has grown as an organisation and now includes 23 Members and 35 Observers. ([ref](https://www.ich.org/))
